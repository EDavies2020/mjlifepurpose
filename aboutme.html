            <p id="top-text">Thank you for this life changing moment to get to know a little of my own life journey and why I do what I do today with <b>Michael J Life Purpose</b> – life coaching, personal training, yoga therapy and massage.</p>
            <p>The reason you have got this far already means that either someone you know told you about me and how I have transformed their life and <b><i>you</i></b> feel like change is on the cards for you, or you have looked up life coaching, yoga and fitness and are personally in need of a new direction or focus. Either way, you are here in this present moment and your life is about to get a whole lot better.</p>

            <p>Whether you need to lose weight, get fit and active, or find a great diet that fits your lifestyle, I can help <b>you</b> discover it. Whether you need to find a new job, get sharper at your job, discover a balance between your work and home life, overcome stress or anxiety, deal with emotional difficulties, improve your relationships, be a good lover or even find one… my approach as your life coach, personal trainer and yoga therapist will help you change your life. Welcome to the beginning of becoming a better you!</p>
            <img class="quote" src="./assets/images/aboutme/quote.jpg" alt="quote">
            <p>So many of us will only ever glimpse the dreams we would really like for our lives, but the reality is we can ALL live the life we want. You may be asking how is that possible? I can assure you that the key is this - if you take just 15 minutes with me to start to <b>think</b> about what you really would like for your life, who you could be, what body you would like, what relationship you would love to have, you will be making a start to making it happen. Dreams can only start with you.</p>
            <p>I began that journey of realisation seven years ago and since discovering self development and that I could change the way things were, I have not once looked back. </p>
            <p>At the age of 42, after a life of constant heart ache, battling with myself and my headstrong career to be a top leader in the education world…and then once I got my dream role being wrongfully dismissed, I was a bit of a mess. The truth of the matter was that I had been bullied all through my life but was used to it. I allowed people to walk into my world and abuse me because that is how I always knew it…so I accepted it. That was my lot in life. Work my butt off only to be judged and hurt by the people I had respected and cared about. The reality? I was used to dealing with adversity and hurt. My mind and behaviours were conditioned by habit. I was ready to give up.</p>
            <img class="onknees" src="./assets/images/aboutme/onknees.jpg" alt="onknees">
            <p>However, when I lost my job, I decided to make an important and crucial decision - <b>I had to change</b>. I realised that I had been blaming everyone else. Wallowing in my own self pity and that I was the victim. I woke up one morning and realised that I had given myself away, allowing others to control me for years. Without realising it, I had let others slowly destroy me and take over my life. But there was a subtle shift in my thinking. I decided that I would take back that control and be in control. I didn’t know how I was going to do it, but it began with one simple decision. I would just start to make that change. Since that illuminating life moment, I have not looked back. Today, I still live in a world just like you, but I now live every day with a clear sense of direction and purpose. Physically, I am 3 stone lighter, fitter than I have ever been in my life and I look and feel great at the age of 49. </p>
