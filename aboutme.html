            <p id="top-text">Thank you for this life changing moment to get to know a little of my own life journey and why I do what I do today with <b>Michael J Life Purpose</b> – life coaching, personal training, yoga therapy and massage.</p>
            <p>The reason you have got this far already means that either someone you know told you about me and how I have transformed their life and <b><i>you</i></b> feel like change is on the cards for you, or you have looked up life coaching, yoga and fitness and are personally in need of a new direction or focus. Either way, you are here in this present moment and your life is about to get a whole lot better.</p>
            <h5>What do I do?</h5>
            <p>Whether you need to lose weight, get fit and active, or find a great diet that fits your lifestyle, I can help <b>you</b> discover it. Whether you need to find a new job, get sharper at your job, discover a balance between your work and home life, overcome stress or anxiety, deal with emotional difficulties, improve your relationships, be a good lover or even find one… my approach as your life coach, personal trainer and yoga therapist will help you change your life. Welcome to the beginning of becoming a better you!</p>
            <img class="quote" src="./assets/images/aboutme/quote.jpg" alt="quote">
            <p>So many of us will only ever glimpse the dreams we would really like for our lives, but the reality is we can ALL live the life we want. You may be asking how is that possible? I can assure you that the key is this - if you take just 15 minutes with me to start to <b>think</b> about what you really would like for your life, who you could be, what body you would like, what relationship you would love to have, you will be making a start to making it happen. Dreams can only start with you.</p>
            <p>I began that journey of realisation seven years ago and since discovering self development and that I could change the way things were, I have not once looked back. </p>
            <p>At the age of 42, after a life of constant heart ache, battling with myself and my headstrong career to be a top leader in the education world…and then once I got my dream role being wrongfully dismissed, I was a bit of a mess. The truth of the matter was that I had been bullied all through my life but was used to it. I allowed people to walk into my world and abuse me because that is how I always knew it…so I accepted it. That was my lot in life. Work my butt off only to be judged and hurt by the people I had respected and cared about. The reality? I was used to dealing with adversity and hurt. My mind and behaviours were conditioned by habit. I was ready to give up.</p>
            <img class="onknees" src="./assets/images/aboutme/onknees.jpg" alt="onknees">
            <p>However, when I lost my job, I decided to make an important and crucial decision - <b>I had to change</b>. I realised that I had been blaming everyone else. Wallowing in my own self pity and that I was the victim. I woke up one morning and realised that I had given myself away, allowing others to control me for years. Without realising it, I had let others slowly destroy me and take over my life. But there was a subtle shift in my thinking. I decided that I would take back that control and be in control. I didn’t know how I was going to do it, but it began with one simple decision. I would just start to make that change. Since that illuminating life moment, I have not looked back. Today, I still live in a world just like you, but I now live every day with a clear sense of direction and purpose. Physically, I am 3 stone lighter, fitter than I have ever been in my life and I look and feel great at the age of 49. </p>
            <img class="michael2" src="./assets/images/aboutme/michael2.jpeg" alt="michael">
            <p>For the past 7 years, I have worked continually and with a passion to support and help others change their lives for the better through life coaching, personal training, being a dedicated yoga teacher and a sports massage therapist. A bit different from a career in language teaching of twenty years I admit. But today, I am living a fulfilled life and each day I truly enjoy being me. I have a great marriage, a wonderful famiIy life with my three grown up children and a granddaughter, and I continue to develop myself, practise self care and learn on a daily basis. I have wonderful clients and work with some of the leading business men and women in the UK. I have discovered how to enjoy life and do the things I only ever dreamed of!</p>
            <p>My mantra for each day is that I want to learn, love and respect others so that I can grow to be an even better version of myself. This way of living is the best way. It is positively infectious and the results with the people I work alongside are staggering!!</p>

                            <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> As a 5 foot nothing geeky IT technician 5 years ago and weighing in at 21 stone, I wasn’t a pleasant sight! I was in an average relationship at that time that was neither negative or positive… but I was just existing and all I realised was that I wanted to get fit. That’s all I wanted to do. That’s what most people do right? But I didn’t really have any idea HOW to get results or know what I was doing…. I thought that by just turning up at the gym it would just miraculously happen. I would become…me.! Wrong. Several months of hard work led to nothing!!<br>
                                Having met Michael at the gym, we embarked upon a truly thought provoking moment that transformed my life forever. Within a year, through Michael’s dedicated coaching of my physical body, diet and emotional life, I lost 8 stone. He carefully helped me change my diet and exercise patterns which were meaningful and sustainable. I could actually live a life that I never dreamed of.  At first, I could only jog 200 meters and then collapse but with a step by step focus, I got to a kilometre, then a park fun run of 5km, followed by a 10km city run one year later. I finally completed three half marathons within two years!<br>
                                Through setting real personal goals and realising that each step was a little but important one, I gained full confidence in myself. I found me. I began to see myself differently. Fat to fit, sad to happy, bored to inspired. I chose to trust Michael and his approach implicitly and I am forever grateful for his magic touch in my life. He saw my true potential and that is now the reality of my full life. This year, I am getting married to the woman of my dreams and have an exciting and meaningful job. I would not hesitate in turning to Michael to help me develop to become the best me and I encourage you to get Michael to help transform your life.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

A friend of mine at work recommended life coaching and that Michael was such a lovely guy. Hesitantly I called him to find out if he could help. Even after the first conversation, I knew I could trust him. He had so much faith in my life and I knew that I could start to change things. He was able to see how I could begin to manage each of my stresses, one by one. Within 6 weeks, I was back in work. I started making time for myself each day, had a better structure so I could help my family and my relationship with Tom my husband is back on track.<br> 
                                I am truly grateful for his insight. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

I was horrified! My whole career was about to be destroyed by my foolish and naive actions. As a result, I was near suicidal. I met Michael through a friend at work and I have never looked back. I found a new confidence in my life and used the structured methods Michael gave me to help with my anxiety and depression. I also have understood setting boundaries for my life to protect me in a meaningful and non judgemental way. I am so much kinder to myself. His approaches are meaningful and I can use them at any time to get me through. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>
