                <h2>Life Coaching</h2>
                <h6>What is a life coach… and what do they do?</h6>
                <p><strong>If you are one of the many people wondering what a life coach is... and what a life coach does, you are not alone. Nearly 1,500 people ask Google what the purpose of a life coach is every single month.</strong></p>
                <p>Agreed…it is not surprising so many people are asking Google what a life coach is, because it sounds like such a vague term.<br>
                    Life is a complex thing, consisting of intimate and social relationships, health, fitness, happiness, money problems, career and so many of other aspects.<br>
                    Each of these things alone can require the help of specialists like relationship councillors, financial planners, personal trainers and even medical professionals.</p>
                <p>So can just one person, a life coach, possibly work with you to improve all these different areas of your life?<br>
                    In short, yes and no.</p>
                <p>Think about a football coach. In most cases, they are not superstar football players, but they know how to get the best out of each of the superstar players that they are coaching.<br>
                    It is the same with a life coach. They might not necessarily be relationship experts, financial planners or medical professionals, but they are experts at establishing what is important in your life, helping you create an action plan to achieve it and giving you all the help, encouragement and motivation to make it all a reality.</p>
                <p>So, to answer your question, "What is a life coach?" </p>
                <h5><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> A life coach is an experienced professional that enables you to identify, plan for and achieve as many of the things you want out of life as possible. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></h5>
                <p>But what about the details? What does a life coach do specifically? What's the purpose of a life coach? Why do people see one? How much do they cost? What techniques do they use?</p>    
                <p>I have put together this guide to answer some commonly asked questions that naturally come to mind when asking about a life coach.</p>
                <p><strong>Here’s everything you will need to know about what a life coach is and how they work broken down into 5 key questions.</strong></p>
                <h4>1. Why do people choose to see a life coach?</h4>
                    <img class="lcquest1" src="./assets/images/services/michaelandson2.jpeg" alt="pier">
                <p>The best way to start explaining what a life coach is, is to look at why people see a life coach in the first place.<br>
                    Whilst some professions have a very limited scope, life coaching has the widest scope you can possibly imagine. The whole spectrum of a person’s entire life is about as wide a scope as there is.<br>
                    With such a wide spectrum of things a person can be experiencing in their own life, you can now imagine that there are a million and one reasons a person may choose to see a life coach.<br>
                    Quite often a person may seek out a coach for clearly definable things.<br>
                    Maybe you are lacking self-confidence, unhappy and unfulfilled. Or maybe you just want to achieve more success in life.<br>
                    Other times it is something less easy to define. Sometimes you just simply do not know what you want but you know you want something more.<br>
                    A good life coach will help you identify exactly what you want out of life. If you already know what that is, then they will help you go out there and grab it with both hands.<br>
                    You see, quite often a person knows what they want out of life but they find it extremely difficult to turn it into a reality.<br>
                    They may procrastinate, lose focus, lack the confidence or even the self-belief that they can do it.<br>
                    When thinking about all of these different reasons, it actually boils down to one single thing why a person actually sees a life coach; their life is just not yet exactly how or where they want it to be.<br>
                    This is the purpose of a life coach. People see a coach because they need a powerful mentor who will help them get their life exactly where they want it to be. Or as practically close to that as possible.<br>
                    With modern technology, people can choose a life coach globally, no matter where they live meaning they can achieve all of the above from the comfort of their own homes.</p>
                <h4>2. What makes a life coach so effective??</h4>
